# Reddit-Messenger-Bot
The program scrapes jokes from Reddit and sends it to messenger.
It is deployed on Herokue in Python. It uses flask and praw mainly.
It avoids redundancy in scraping by using sql to store the recently sent items.

Below are the screenshots for the bot. Due to Facebook's requirement for a privacy policy, the bot isn't made live but is in the testing mode.
